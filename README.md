Knights of Nom server config

Welcome to the repository for Knights of Nom! This repo contains our current running mission and server PBO's,
a directory that contains the master (vanilla) files for mods and scripts that we have added, as well as a working folder
that contains our current unpacked PBO's that we are working on.

If you wish to use our config, always grab the latest version number from the PBO folder. You CAN take the unpacked folders
and pack them yourself, however these folders are volatile in that we modify them frequently, and may contain broken code.
PBO's listed in the PBO's folder will ALWAYS be stable (though not neccessarily feature complete), so again it is recommended
to use these files. Experimental and testing PBO's will likely be in the working folder.

As always, most edits are done in Notepadd++, and packing/unpacking is done with PBO manager.
